# ChatProject

Started off this project with the intention to make a program where the computer would make a "Would you rather?" statement, then ask an {A} question and a {B} question. The user would enter either A or B and the computer would repeat their answer back to them. Once I got that working I wanted to have a second user also interact with the site, meaning two users would be answer the A or B question. Once both have answered, the computer would determine whether they answered the same, or differently. If it was the same the computer would congratulate both users for finding a match. If the answer was different one of the users would be booted from the chat and replaced with a new user.

Since I am new to coding I thought this would be simple to do, but now I realize that it's trickier than I thought! So at the moment I'm working on being comfortable with basic coding fuctions before delving into my actual project.

I used Pj5 and copied the basic "input and button"

Tried out some tutorials from htmldog.com, got it to make the title of the page change. Then I tried to play around with some of the other elements and the page stopped working completely. Deleted my index.html file by accident.

Brought back my old version and got it working again. By solving this issue I realized the difference between the index.html and the sketch.js files, so that was a big win for me! Changed some of the text so that the program was asking questions rather than using the default text. 

Tried adding a second button with https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createButton but that did not work as I was unsure about where to put it in the code. Experimeted to see if I needed to make a new javascript file for it to live inside, but that didn't seem to do anything either. At this point my original button is not showing up even though it's still in the code, and this new button is there that allows me to click to change the colour of a square. Still working on how to make both show up at the same time.

Learned about paragraph breaks, bold text, headings and lists from the HTMLDog site and incorporated them into my page.

Made a link and added an image with customized proportions to my page.

Added a few styles of forms. This part was cool! I was able to make a drop-down menu with customized options as well as a few text entry forms of various sizes.

Played with the text and link colours inside the HTML. Chose "Salmon" and "Plum" because I figured those would be colours that Mittens would like.

Realized that I don't understand how css works. Made a new file called style.css and tried to follow along with tutorial but nothing that I was doing was showing up. Haven't figured out how to make it link up yet.

That's it for now!
